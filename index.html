        <span>In React, props is short for "properties" and is a way to pass data from a parent component to a child
            component. The parent component can pass data to the child component by adding attributes to the child
            component's JSX element, and the child component can access that data through the props object. The props
            object is read-only, meaning the child component cannot modify the data passed down to it via props.</span>

            We have a navbar with name as "Texter app" and we want to change the name of the navbar dynammically, we do
            not want it to be hardcoded, so where we are calling that navbar components for eg. in the APP.js file we
            will
            simply pass the props in it and will access the props in the navbar components.

                Simply where we are Rendering the component we can pass props from parent -> children like this.

                How to use props:
            </div>
            <p>
                here in this pic. on the first line we are using props using Object destructuring (Note:
                the name using in the destructuring should be same as the props passed).
                <br> In the third line we are using destructured object

            <h2>PropTypes: </h2>
            <p>Proptypes are basically used to set the type of the props, it can be a string type, integer type or
                anything else, Once the data type of the prop is set and if you pass the prop with other data type it
                will give warning in the console, will be easy to track the error
            <div class="img"><img src="Images/navbar4.png" alt=""></div>
            <br>
            <p class="min_head">isRequired</p>
            <p>
                .isRequired is used with Proptype if the prop is not passed but it is something without which out
                compnent
                will not be completed in that case we will use isRequired throw error in console.

            <p>it is used when you are not sure that everytime the prop will be passed. In that case we will use the
                default propType</p>

            <h2>State</h2>
            <p>
            <div class="imp_txt">Short Note: </div>
            <span>useState is a built-in hook in React that allows functional components to have state and re-render
                when that state changes. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two
                elements: the current state value and a function to update that value.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
            <div class="imp_txt">Example: </div>
            <span>When you use useState in a functional component in React, you need to pass an initial value to it as
                an argument. For example, let's say you want to track a count in your component, and you want to
                initialize it to 0</span>
            </p>
            <div class="img"><img src="Images/state1.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>
                In the code above, we pass 0 as the initial value to useState. The useState function returns an array
                with two elements: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The first element is the current state value, which we've assigned to the count variable using array
                    destructuring. Initially, count is set to 0.</li>
                <li>The second element is a function that allows us to update the state value. We've assigned this
                    function
                    to setCount. We can call setCount with a new value to update the count state. In the example above,
                    we
                    use setCount(count + 1) to increment the count by 1 whenever the "Increment" button is clicked.</li>
                <p>So, in summary, useState takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two
                    elements:
                    the current state value and a function to update that value.</p>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2>Event Handlers</h2>
            <p>
                React lets you add event handlers to your JSX. Event handlers are your own functions that will be
                triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.
            </p>
            <div class=" img"><img src="Images/eh1.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>In the above image you can see i have called an event like onClick so it will be triggered when ever
                someone will click the specific button, but here as you can see in the console the output is there
                without even clicking on the button</p>
            <br>

            <div class="imp_txt">(*)</div>
            <span> Keep it in mind whenever you are calling your
                funcition it should'nt be
                function call (with parenthesis), Always it will be a function passed in the event Handeler. In image it
                should be </span>
            <div class="imp_txt">handleClearText
            </div><span>without the parenthesis.</span>


            <p style="padding-top: 10px" class="imp_txt">Note: <span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you call the function
                    which contains useState
                    hook it will
                    stuck into
                    an infinite loop and will
                    throw the error, can see below in the img..</span></p>
